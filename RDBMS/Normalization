Relational Design and Normalization

Normalization = reduce data redundancy 

3 Forms of Normalization:

1 Normal Form (1NF)
- no duplicated rows, must be uniquely identifiable
- each column only contains a single value
- each value cannot be further split (eg. First name and Last name can be seperated)

2 Normal Form (2NF)
- must be in 1NF
- no partial dependency (table can only contain attributes that is related to all the primary keys of the table, if the attribute only depends either 1 of the primary keys, the attribute and the dependent primary key will have form a seperate table)

3 Normal Form (3NF)
- must be in 1NF and 2NF
- no transitive dependency (table cannot contain attributes that depend on non primary key attribute instead of the primary key)

Denormalisation = improve query performance at the expense of storage and data accuracy
