## Run a command to see all the processes running on the server owned by everyone.
ps -a

## Confirm the username you are running as.
echo $USER

## Run a command to see all the processes running on the server and use grep to select only the processes your user is running.
ps -ef | grep "ubuntu"

## Repeat the previous exercise. This time, select every process except things running as you.
ps -ef | grep -v "ubuntu"

## Show the process info for our current session without using a grep command.
ps aux

## Show the process tree for the current session.
ps -ef f

## Run a process check on the server but only output the User, pid and cmd columns to your results.
ps -eo user,pid,command

## Run a process check to pull all of the process ids running on the server and put the output into a file named list in your home directory.
ps -eo pid > list

## Run the following series of commands:

sleep 300 &

Find this command by checking the processes and running a grep
ps -ef | grep "sleep 300&"

Stop the process using the process id
kill 1193

## Run a command to see a dynamic view of all the processes running on your host.
ps -ef

## Now run the same command but specifically only for root.
ps -ef | grep "root"

## Experiment with the following commands while running top and note your observations:

z
Changes the syntax font color to red = highlight running process to the top

c
Encapsulates the command in [] = absoulute pathway to each processes

Shift P
Sort processes by CPU utilisation

k
PID to signal/kill [the first pid on top] = allow killing of processes

## Run a command to check network connectivity between your Linux session and yahoo.com.
ping yahoo.com

## show the network route between your session and yahoo.com and output the contents into a file named yahoo.route in your home directory.
traceroute yahoo.com > yahoo.route

## View the file using less and see how many hops it took to get there.
20

## Create a soft link named route to your network route.
ln -s yahoo.route route

## Run a command to see all the network sockets on your server and output to a file named output in your home directory.
netstat -a > output

## Create a folder named network in your home directory.
mkdir network

## Move your route file and network output file into the network folder you just created.
mv yahoo.route output ~/network/

## Run the command to query your network interfaces on your session.
ifconfig

## Run the following command to put your results in the directory the trainer specified.
