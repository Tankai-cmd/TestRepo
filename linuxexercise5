## Run a command to see the disk usage across your file system.
df

## Run the command again. This time ensure the output is in human-readable format and added to a file named filesystem.usage in your home directory.
df -h

## Show the disk usage for your home directory.
df /

## Show the disk usage for your home directory in human-readable format and add it a file named disk.usage in your home directory.
df -h / > disk.usage

## Run a disk check specifically showing output for all files and folders in human-readable format. Put the results into usage2 in your home directory.
du -ah > usage2

## Show the disk usage for everything in /var.
du -h /var

## Run a disk usage command on your home directory that will follow any links if you have them set up and display the output in human-readable format.
du -hL ~/list

## Create a folder named disk in your home directory.
mkdir disk

## Copy your output files from exercise 2, exercise 4, and exercise 5 into this folder.
cp output2 output4 output 5 ~/disk

## Move into the disk folder.
cd disk

## Run a command to create an archive tar file named disk.tar that includes everything in this folder.
tar -cvf disk.tar ./

## Reverse the previous command and undo the archive.
tar -xvf disk.tar

## Now run an archive of these files to ensure it creates a g-zipped tarball named disk.tar.gz in a single-line command.
tar -czvf disk.tar.gz ./

## Create an empty file named newdisk in this directory.
touch ~/disk/newdisk

## Uncompress the gz file you created so that it is back to being just a tar file.
tar -xzvf disk.tar.gz

## Add the newdisk file to the tar file.
tar -rvf disk.tar newdisk

## Compress the tar file again to make a g-zipped tarball again.
tar -czvf disk.tar.gz ./

## Create another directory named disk_output in your home directory.
mkdir ~/disk_output

## Uncompress your tarball to the directory you just created.
tar -xzvf disk.tar.gz ~/disk_output

## Go back to your home directory and run a command to g-zip your disk_output directory. Ensure it recursively compresses everything.
gzip -r output.tar.gz ~/disk_output 

## Run the following command to put your results in the directory specified by your instructor.
